            <h2> My name is Opeyemi and living the simple live saved my life </h2>
            <p> <strong> I used to be a pack rat</strong> I had so many things that i thought that i loved, but the
                truth
                was i couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much </p>
            <p> Things were terrible, I had a job that i hated , a home i didn't want to live in and i couldn't hold a
                relationship </p>
            <h3> How i turned things around </h3>
            <p> <strong> I was on the verge of breakdown when i got rid of everything </strong>
                I literally put 99% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved in a smaller apartment and
                i quit my job </p>
            <p> It wasn't easy at all but everything around me was in such a bad place , I didn't know what else to do
                and it worked </p>

            <h3> Now I live the simple life </h3>
            <p> Now that i'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed , enjoy life and work
                article-read-more
                , and i have more freee time to enjoy
            </p>
            <p> With how much it turned my life around, <strong>
                    I felt like i had no choice but to start sharing how i did it
                </strong>, and how others can benefit from living a asimple life as well, which is why i started this
                site 
            </p>
